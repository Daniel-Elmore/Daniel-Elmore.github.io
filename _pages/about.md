Anchored in economic reasoning, my approach to data analysis goes beyond reporting metrics to uncover the institutional and behavioral dynamics that shape results. I connect statistical outcomes to the incentives, trade-offs, and second-order effects that drive organizational performance.

I work at the intersection of data analysis, business strategy, and applied economics. Leaders depend on me to structure disordered datasets, identify patterns others overlook, and translate findings into insights that are analytically rigorous, business-focused, and operationally viable.

Currently pursuing an M.A. in Economics at George Mason University, I combine academic rigor with technical skill to support data-driven decision-making, strategic planning, and growth optimization.
