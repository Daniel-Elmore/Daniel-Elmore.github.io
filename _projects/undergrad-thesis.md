## Overview
This senior honors thesis examined how Congressâ€™s evolving fiscal role has shaped labor market potential. By analyzing tax policy, spending behavior, and labor supply responses, the project evaluated the extent to which institutional dynamics influence economic outcomes. 

## Methods
- Empirical analysis conducted in **Excel and R** with econometric modeling  
- Review of fiscal multipliers and labor supply elasticities  
- Policy evaluation framed through both historical and institutional perspectives  

## Key Findings
- Rising fiscal commitments often produced **diminishing marginal gains in labor force participation**, especially under expansionary spending regimes.  
- Congressional budgetary behavior displayed a **pro-cyclical bias**, amplifying rather than dampening economic fluctuations.  
- Tax policy adjustments exhibited **asymmetric effects**: labor supply responses were stronger under tax cuts than under equivalent increases.  

## Recognition
- Presented at the **50th Annual Eastern Economic Association Conference** (2024)
