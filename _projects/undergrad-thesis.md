## Overview
This senior honors thesis explored how U.S. fiscal policy — through government spending and taxation — interacts with labor force participation. By analyzing historical data across multiple fiscal categories, the project identified nonlinear, threshold-style effects, suggesting the existence of an optimal balance where fiscal policy most effectively supports labor market engagement. The work reframes the policy debate from “more vs. less” spending toward finding a sustainable equilibrium.

## Methods
- Historical data on federal expenditures, receipts, GDP, tax rates, and labor force participation  
- Scatterplots with polynomial trendlines to capture nonlinear relationships  
- Econometric analysis in **Excel and R** to test correlations across multiple categories  
- Framework grounded in institutional and historical perspectives  

## Key Findings
- Fiscal policy effects on labor supply are **nonlinear**, often resembling “Laffer-Curve style” relationships.  
- Both expenditures and receipts showed **quadratic, cubic, and quartic patterns**, depending on category and magnitude.  
- Evidence points to an **optimal juncture** of spending and taxation where labor force participation is maximized.  
- Over- or under-intervention can reduce labor engagement, challenging the adequacy of simple linear models.  

## Recognition
- Presented at the **50th Annual Eastern Economic Association Conference** (2024)
